# Assets

## PNGs, SVGs, JPGs

These assets can be copied and pasted directly into the Figma file.

### Resizing

Elements can be resized either by

1. Using the second section under the Design panel by either

   - Targeting the height and width individually, or
   - As one using the Constrain Proportions property (appears as a link icon).
     NB we can carry out math in the text boxes under this section eg if we type 342/2 in the width text box and press enter Figma will calculate it to be 171.

2. Using the mouse either
   - alone,
   - with shift to constrain its proportions, or
   - with shift and option to constrain its proportions and align it to the center.

## Naming Elements

Elements are automatically given a name when they are created however, we can rename them.

When renaming elements we can tell Figma what kind of element is it and then then assign it a value eg

```
Button / Primary will let Figma know that the element is a button and the value is primary
```

# Style

To have quick access to pre-styled reusuable fonts and colors we can turn them into a style, and if/when these styles are updated they will also update all elements using said styles automatically.

## Fonts

1. Select the font family, size, weight and any other styles needed
2. Click on the Style Icon
3. Click the + button
4. Give the style a name
5. Click on Create Style

## Colors

1. Under Fill or Stroke select the color or colors (depending on the style eg solid, linear, etc) and the opacity and other stroke styles needed
2. Click on the Style Icon
3. Click the + button
4. Give the style a name
5. Click on Create Style

# Components

A component is a reusable asset that can be utilised throughout all designs.

The main component will have a symbol of four small squares and any instances/uses of the component will have an outlined diamond.

If the main component is edited, all instances of that component will also change. This allows you to save time by not having to individually edit each element.

## Component Sets

When a component set is created we can rename the component property under Property in the Design panel by selecting the componenet then pressing edit.

The varients of the component will also appear under the Properties set and can be selected when needed.

# Shortcuts

1. Use Command to directly select an element even if it is nested.
2. Use Shift + a to apply auto layout to elements.
3. Use Command + D or Option + drag the mouse to duplicate elements.
4. Use Shift + i to open all components, plugins and widgets.
