# What is UX Design

The first part of UX design is to get a brief on the project and figuring out who is going to be using the project.

There are three steps to UX design with these being

- Assumptions
  This is made based on the brief and who the site is for, what they might like, what should and should not appear on the project and the language is to be used. Ensure you have a clear idea of who is being targeted to ensure.
- Testing
  Test the site using people who the site is meant to be for.
- Iteration
  Once testing is completed, you need to evaluate the site and iterate it. Once this is done, go back to the begining to make new assumptions, retest and make iterations as needed. Do this until the website meets the client and users needs.

# Figma

Figma is rapid prototyping and is a desgin tool.

## Wireframe

A wireframe is a simple version of a website that can be tested really easy. It has no details just a rudimentary strutcure.

## High Fidelity Mockups

Once a wireframe is complete, we can them add in all the other details to the project for eg brand colors, logos, fonts, etc.

## Using Adobe Illustrator in Figma

If the image is too complex for figma we can follow the steps below:

1. Highlight the image and go to Object, Blend and then Make.
2. Go to Properties in the right panel, Blend Options, select Specified Steps then state the number of steps to take.
3. If there are still problems in Figma, go to Object, Blendn then Expand. Afterwards go to Object, Path and Outline Stroke.

# Project

## Briefing

The mobile website is for a co-working space about to open that needs to be able to have a mailing list for potential customers to know when the space is ready as well as for marketing, promotions and advertising.

## Persona

Our ideal customer is a woman named Karen in her 40s and is married with kids. She works for a multi-national company that is based in another country and needs a space to work. Karen is aware of what a co-working space is and just needs to find a professional space with a sense of community.
